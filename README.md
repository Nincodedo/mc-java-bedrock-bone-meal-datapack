Bedrock Bone Meal Datapack is a Minecraft Java datapack that recreates some of Minecraft Bedrock's bone meal functionality for players and dispensers. If you are playing with this datapack on a server, you will need to enabled command blocks in the server.properties.

## Player Interactions

## Dispenser Interactions

Dispensers can use bone meal to grow sugar cane, just like players. After first loading this datapack, you will need to break and replace existing dispensers for this to work properly.
